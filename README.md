# Welcome to my Maze Race game!

## Description
This is a small Unity game I made for a final project in a university course. All scripts and prefabs are my own, except for the Slime prefab and the RPG Monster Duo Polyart assets folder (property of user Dungeon Mason on Unity). Import the MazeRace.unitypackage into Unity to get this game.

### How to play
  * Start by opening the "Start Game" scene. 
  * Press play in Unity.
  * Controls:
    * ↑ to move forward.
    * ← to rotate the camera left 
    * → to rotate the camera right. 
    * Press space to change the camera view between first person and top down view. In top down, you'll appear as a yellow sphere. 
    
#### How to win
Race the slime monster to the finish. Difficulty chooses how often the slime monster will move. Start at the yellow cylinder, finish at the orange cylinder.
